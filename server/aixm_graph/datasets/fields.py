        The purpose of this class is to keep the essential information of an `etree.Element`.
        The namespace information is discarded because it is repeated in all the `etree.Element`
        instances of a parsed file, thus not redundant memory is used.

        Additionally the `attrib` attribute is deep copied (below) in order to avoid keeping
        reference to it and consequently to the parent element. All those elements are supposed to
        be deleted by the parser `server.datasets.AIXMDataSet.parse` after having been read in order
        to avoid memory overflow in case of huge files with thousands of elements.
